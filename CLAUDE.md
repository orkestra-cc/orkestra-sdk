# Orkestra SDK

_Path: `/backend/pkg/sdk`_
_Parent: [../../CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)_

## What this is

The **public contract layer** between the Orkestra kernel and every module.
A separate Go module hosted in-tree:

```
module github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-sdk
```

Bound to `backend/` via the repo-root `go.work` plus a `replace` directive
in `backend/go.mod`. Phase 4 of the SDK split publishes this same tree to
its own GitHub repo (`orkestra-cc/orkestra-sdk`); the import path is
chosen so that move is a no-op for every consumer.

For the conceptual / new-developer walkthrough see
[../../../docs/onboarding/orkestra-sdk.md](../../../docs/onboarding/orkestra-sdk.md).
For the multi-phase migration plan see
[../../../docs/plans/orkestra-sdk-split.md](../../../docs/plans/orkestra-sdk-split.md).

## Load-bearing invariant: SDK self-containment

**No file in `pkg/sdk/` may import anything from `backend/internal/`.**

This is the single rule that keeps the SDK publishable. Anything inside
this tree must compile against ONLY:

- the Go standard library
- the third-party modules listed in `go.mod` (huma/v2, chi/v5, google/uuid,
  prometheus, mongo-driver)
- other packages inside `pkg/sdk/`

Verify before any PR that touches this tree:

```bash
grep -rn "internal/" backend/pkg/sdk/ --include="*.go"
```

A clean run shows only doc-comment hits ("see internal/shared/X for the
backend impl"), never an actual `import` line. CI does not gate this
explicitly yet — the grep is the gate.

## Package map

| Package | Purpose | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `module/` | Module interface + 16 optional sub-interfaces, BaseModule, ModuleRegistry, ServiceRegistry, ConfigService, RouteInfo, RedisClient, secrets (AES-256-GCM helpers). The boot kernel. | Required surface frozen at v1 |
| `iface/` | Cross-module interfaces (UserProvider, TenantProvider, AuthzProvider, NotificationSender, JWTProvider, PDFProvider, AIModelProvider, RAGQueryProvider, AuditSink, BillingTenantProvider, PaymentProvider, …) + their DTOs (User, OAuthLink, Tenant, NotificationRequest, …). | Additive-only |
| `ctxauth/` | Request-context getters: `GetUserUUID`, `GetTenantID`, `GetTenantRoles`, `GetClientIP`, `IsImpersonating`, `TenantKindFromContext`. Plus the exported `Key*` string constants the backend AuthMiddleware writes against. | Frozen |
| `modulegate/` | `ModuleGate(checker, name)` HTTP middleware (503 when disabled) + `ModuleEnabledChecker` interface. | Frozen |
| `tenantrepo/` | Fail-closed Mongo query helpers (`Scope`, `MustScope`, `StampInsert`, `StampInsertM`, `ScopeAggregate`, `RequireInternalTenant`, `RequireExternalTenant`) + `ErrTenantScopeMissing` / `ErrTenantKindMismatch` sentinels. | Frozen |
| `capability/` | `Capability` struct + `Registry`. The unit a tenant subscribes to. | Frozen |
| `metrics/` | Default Prometheus registry + a `Default` snapshot. | Frozen |

## Versioning policy

The SDK is on the path to v1.0 publication. Until then:

- **Additive-only changes** to existing interfaces and DTOs. Adding a new
  method to `iface.UserProvider` is a breaking change for every consumer
  that implements it — instead add a new sub-interface (`HasFooProvider`)
  and have callers type-assert.
- **The `Module` interface is frozen at 3 methods** (`Name`, `Category`,
  `Init`). New module capabilities go behind optional sub-interfaces in
  `module/module.go` — see the existing `HasConfigSchema`,
  `HasNavItems`, `Startable`, … pattern. Never widen `Module`.
- **DTO field additions** in `iface/` should be optional (pointer types
  or `omitempty`) so older implementations keep compiling. Required
  fields are major-version bumps.
- **No new third-party dependencies** without a deliberate decision. The
  current set is intentional. Pulling in another large module
  (especially one with its own transitive driver/encoder/etc.) becomes
  a forced transitive dep on every future external addon.

## When code goes here vs `internal/`

| Concern | Goes in `pkg/sdk/` | Goes in `internal/shared/` or `internal/core/` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interface every module needs to consume or implement | ✅ | ❌ |
| Concrete implementation of one of those interfaces | ❌ | ✅ (in the producing module) |
| Pure data manipulation, no I/O or framework deps | ✅ if module-author-facing | ✅ if backend-internal |
| Database client wrapper, OAuth flow, cookie helpers, geoip | ❌ | ✅ |
| Anything that imports `shared/config` or auth-internal types | ❌ | ✅ |
| HTTP middleware tied to AuthMiddleware lifecycle | ❌ | ✅ (`internal/shared/middleware`) |
| HTTP middleware addons need to wrap their own routes with | ✅ | ❌ |

When in doubt, ask: **"Could an addon extracted to its own GitHub repo
import this?"** If yes, it belongs here. If it references config.Config,
auth's `*models.JWTClaims`, or any backend-private package, it doesn't.

## Module path: choose stably

Every Go file in this tree imports siblings via the public path:

```go
import (
    "github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-sdk/iface"
    "github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-sdk/ctxauth"
    "github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-sdk/module"
)
```

Never `github.com/orkestra/backend/pkg/sdk/...` — that path doesn't exist
as a Go module identity. Existing files were rewritten in commit `a2fd7eb`
(Phase 3); regression checks should grep for `orkestra/backend/pkg/sdk`
and fail.

## go.mod hygiene

When you add a third-party import inside `pkg/sdk/`:

1. Add it to `pkg/sdk/go.mod` `require` block.
2. `cd backend/pkg/sdk && go mod tidy`.
3. If the dep is also used by `backend/`, **align versions**. The repo-
   root `go.work` resolves both modules to a single copy of each
   transitive dep at build time; mismatched explicit `require` versions
   between the two modules cause obscure type errors.

The `Makefile`'s `backend-deps` target tidies both modules; running it
locally after any dep change keeps the two `go.mod`s in sync.

## Rules

- **Never import `backend/internal/*` from inside `pkg/sdk/`.** This is
  the one rule that, if broken, makes the whole split pointless.
- **Never widen the `Module` interface.** New capabilities go behind a
  new `HasFoo` / `Fooable` sub-interface in `module/module.go` and the
  registry calls them via type-assertion accessors (`FooOf(m)`).
- **Never add a required method to an existing `iface` interface.**
  Doing so breaks every external implementor at compile time. Add a new
  interface and have the registry probe with `module.GetTyped[T]`.
- **Encryption helpers live here, not via `shared/utils`.** The SDK has
  its own `secrets.go` reading `OAUTH_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — the
  algorithm matches `internal/shared/utils.{Encrypt,Decrypt}OAuthToken`
  so secrets are interchangeable, but the SDK never imports utils.
- **`tenantrepo` returns SDK-native sentinel errors** (`ErrTenantScopeMissing`,
  `ErrTenantKindMismatch`), never the `internal/shared/errors` builders.
  Backend code that wants HTTP-shaped responses wraps further with its
  own typed errors at the boundary.
- **`Dependencies.Config` is typed `any` deliberately.** Don't add a
  type-specific accessor in the SDK. The only consumer is auth, which
  type-asserts to `*config.Config` at boot. Phase 1c will retire the
  field entirely.

## CI

`backend-test` and `backend-test-ci` Make targets depend on the SDK
counterparts (`sdk-test`, `sdk-test-ci`) so the existing CI pipeline
covers both modules without a separate workflow. The SDK runs the same
golangci-lint config as `backend/` via the `sdk-lint` target:

```bash
make sdk-test       # quick test pass
make sdk-test-ci    # race + coverage
make sdk-lint       # full lint
```

CI invokes `ci-backend` which chains all of the above plus
`backend-tenantscope` (operates on `backend/internal/`, unaffected by
the SDK split) and the build-profile matrix.
